# Smart_Home
an IOT smart home using Arduino and integrated with a mobile app built with flutter.

We will use two sensors which are DHT11 for measuring temperature/humidity, and MQ135 sensor for determining the air quality. Both a humidifier and a 5V DC fan were used as actuators to adjust humidity and air quality in specific ranges.
